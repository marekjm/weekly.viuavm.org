    <p>
        Another attempt at documenting user-visible Viua interface is being made.
        There are several things that require attention, and which <em>have to</em> be documented.
        In no particular order:
    </p>

    <ul>
        <li> the instruction set </li>
        <li> what is a register? </li>
        <li> what is a <em>register set</em>? </li>
        <li> how to access values held in registers? </li>
        <li> what is the execution model of the VM (asynchronously communicating processes)? </li>
        <li> how to send and receive messages? </li>
        <li> how to handle errors? </li>
        <li> how to do I/O? </li>
    </ul>

    <p>
        These are all important issues, but Viua does not currently provide documentation for them in any
        form.
        There are several articles in a few places, almost 600 example programs written for Viua, but this is
        not enough for the VM to be usable.
    </p>

    <p>
        The newest place when documentation can be found is <a href="https://docs.viuavm.org/manual.txt">here</a>.
        It combines documentation of available instructions with explanations of the core concepts of Viua VM:
        registers, register sets, value lifetimes, types, processes, messages, exceptions and error handling.

    <p>
        Explicit <code>new</code>s were removed from Viua code, removing the last place where naked pointers
        to dynamically allocated objects were used and increasing the overall reliability of Viua VM.
