<p>
    This was a somewhat slow week and only a few changes landed in Viua.
    Two new instructions are usable, which brings Viua a tiny bit closer to the goal of supporting wrapping,
    checked, and saturating arithmetic for signed and unsigned integers.

    <p>
        Signed saturating arithmetic increment (<code>saturatingsincrement</code>) and
        decrement (<code>saturatingsdecrement</code>) instructions were implemented.
        For now, these are the only ones that are usable for saturating arithmetic.

    <p>
        For a project implementing efficient saturating arithmetic in C++ look at Stefan Hamminga's
        <a href="https://github.com/StefanHamminga/saturating_types">saturating_types</a> repository on
        GitHub.
