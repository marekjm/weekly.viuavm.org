<p>
    It was a slow week for the VM.

    <p>
        The C++ standard used for Viua VM was updated to C++17.
        The switch involved nothing more than changing <code>-std=c++14</code> to
        <code>-std=c++17</code> for <a href="https://gcc.gnu.org/projects/cxx-status.html">GCC</a>, and
        <code>-std=c++1z</code> for <a href="http://clang.llvm.org/cxx_status.html">Clang</a>.
    </p>

    <p>
        The switch was mostly cosmetic, and Viua VM does not currently use C++17 features extensively.

    <p>
        Function attributes augment the syntax used for function headers:
    </p>

    {% highlight python %}
'.function:' ( '[[' attribute... ']]' )? function-name
    {% endhighlight %}

    <p>
        Intended use for attributes is to provide additional information to the assembler, or
        instruct the assembler to perform (or <em>not</em> to perform) a specific action with regard
        to a function.
    </p>

    <p>
        For example, a hypothetical <code>inline</code> attribute would instruct the assembler to
        inline calls to a function.
    </p>

    <section>
        <h2> The <code>no_sa</code> attribute </h2>

        <p>
            The only currently implemented attribute is <code>no_sa</code>, meaning "<em>no static analysis</em>".
            Its purpose is to disable static analysis on a per-function basis, as opposed to the per-compilation module
            basis that is now provided via <code>--no-sa</code> assembler flag.
        </p>

        <p>
            The attribute is provided as a workaround for bugs (i.e. false positives) in the static analyser supplied by Viua VM.
            The static analyser is currently unable to use all available information, and
            is also unable to check some cases but errs on the side of caution and assumes that if it does not know whether an
            instruction would crash at runtime or not it decides that it <em>would</em> crash and throws an error.
        </p>

        <p>
            Sometimes the reported errors may be almost hilariously long because the SA reports the whole trace detailing how
            it came to the conclusion that the instruction would cause an error.
        </p>

        <p>
            The previous workaround for false positives was to split a file into two compilation units: one with the function for
            which the false positive was reported, and one with the rest of the code.
            Then, the unit with the single function would be compiled with the <code>--no-sa</code> flag to suppress the errors.
        </p>

        <p>
            However, this approach was cumbersome and highly inconvenient.
            The <code>no_sa</code> attribute will be a much more usable way to suppress false positives.
        </p>
    </section>

    <section>
        <h2> Instruction attributes? </h2>

        <p>
            This would be similar to the function attributes.
            The example use case would be to make the `.unused:` directive, that is currently be used to tell the SA that a value
            produced by an instruction may be unused, into an attribute.
            The code would look like this:
        </p>

        {% highlight asm %}
; this is the current way
text %1 local "Hello World!"
.unused: %1

; this would be the "attribute way"
text [[maybe_unused]] %1 local "Hello World!"
        {% endhighlight %}
