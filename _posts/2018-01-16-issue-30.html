<p>
    Last week was spent only on writing documentation.
    No new code was introduced to the codebase of the VM.
    The work will most likely resume after most currently available features are documented.

    <p>
        Basic documentation is now available for
        <a href="https://docs.viuavm.org/manual.html#4-1">assembler</a>,
        <a href="https://docs.viuavm.org/manual.html#4-2">kernel</a>,
        and <a href="https://docs.viuavm.org/manual.html#4-3">assembler</a>.
    </p>

    <h3>Assembler</h3>

    <p>
        Features of the assembler (type checking, static control-flow and register access analysis, type
        inference) are now shortly described.
        Also, it is noted that the assembler also performs the role of the linker.
    </p>

    <h3>Kernel</h3>

    <p>
        Kernel <a href="https://docs.viuavm.org/manual.html#4-2-1">environment variables</a> are described.
        These variables may be used to tune some aspects of the kernel, or enable execution traces which are
        useful for debugging your programs (or the VM).
    </p>

    <h3>Disassembler</h3>

    <p>
        A brief description is provided, along with the list of its deficiencies.
        Disassembler is probably the least-frequently used tool of the three, so these deficiencies are not
        high on the list of priorities (for now, at least).
