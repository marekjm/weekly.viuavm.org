<p>
    New documentation is being written.
    So far it does not cover all instructions and is not as in-depth as it should be, but it is only a matter
    of time before it will be.
</p>

    <p>
        New documentation is written in a form of a single-file document covering
        <strong><em>everything</em></strong> there is to cover about the VM.
        Available instructions, syntax of the assembly language, tools that are shipped in a standard
        distribution, programming techniques, etc.
    </p>

    <p>
        There are three versions of the manual (all with the same content):
    </p>

    <ul>
        <li> <a href="https://docs.viuavm.org/manual.txt">plaintext</a> version </a> </li>
        <li> <a href="https://docs.viuavm.org/manual.html">colorised HTML</a> version (dark background, light
            text) </a> </li>
        <li> <a href="https://docs.viuavm.org/manual.nocolor.html">browser-default HTML</a> version (whatever
            your browser-default colors happen to be </a> </li>
    </ul>

    <p>
        All versions have <em>exactly</em> the same content, and are rendered in <em>exactly</em> the same
        way; except for the colors and links from ToC to sections in the HTML versions.
