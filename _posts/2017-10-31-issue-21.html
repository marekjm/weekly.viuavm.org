<p>
    New static analyser was merged into <code>devel</code> branch.
    This is a pretty big change.

        Expect your code to stop compiling.

    <p>
        New static analyser has been merged into <code>devel</code> branch and
        is considered ready to use.
        It is not bug-free, however, and so you can expect some false positives (the SA
        errs on the side of caution) and, possibly, a bit of fighting with the analyser.
        If it will be too much of a PITA you can either slap <code>[[no_sa]]</code> attribute on
        a function, or pass <code>--no-sa</code> flag to the assembler when compiling a problematic
        unit.
    </p>

    <p>
        The new static analyser does pretty much everything that the old one was doing, but adds
        additional details to error reports and performs some extra checks.
    </p>

    <p>
        One <em>big</em> addition is compile-time type checking and type inference which means that
        some classes of errors are either completely eliminated or will now surface during
        compilation (e.g. executing an instruction with an invalid operand type should no longer
        happen).
        Type checking and inference works only on instructions, and only on function-by-function
        basis, which means that every function is analysed in isolation and function calls are not
        type-checked (this will be implemented in the future).

    <p>
        A few notes on the topic of porting your code to new SA, and future proofing it.
    </p>

    <section>
        <h2> Explicit register sets </h2>

        <p>
            Always use explicit register sets.
            This will prevent many SA errors, and also make your code future-proof as using implicit
            register sets is a deprecated practice.
        </p>
    </section>

    <section>
        <h2> "Current" register set </h2>

        <p>
            Do not use "current" register set.
            This pseudo-register-set is deprecated and will be removed.
        </p>
    </section>

    <section>
        <h2> OO instructions </h2>

        <p>
            Do not use OO instructions (
            <code>class</code>,
            <code>register</code>,
            <code>new</code>,
            <code>prototype</code>,
            <code>msg</code>
            ).
            I have doubts as to the quality of their design and implementation.
            They will most probably be either removed or reworked, and SA was not implemented for them.
            This lack of support means that code using OO instructions will most probably fail to
            compile with errors about unused values, using empty registers, or overwriting of unused
            values.
        </p>

        <p>
            The solution to this is to use <code>[[no_sa]]</code> in source code, or
            passing the <code>--no-sa</code> flag when compiling units using OO instructions.
