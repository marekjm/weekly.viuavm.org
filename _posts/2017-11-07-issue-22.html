<p>
    Constructor instruction naming is now more consistent.
    The work on giving Viua reliable arithmetic is resumed.

    <p>
        Some constructor instructions (i.e. instructions that create completely new values, instead
        of modifying existing ones, or making modified copies) were renamed to better express what
        they do, and to make the naming consistent.
        Now all constructors are spelled as nouns naming the value they create.
    </p>

    <p>
        The following instructions were renamed:

        <ul>
            <li> <code>istore</code> to <code>integer</code> </li>
            <li> <code>fstore</code> to <code>float</code> </li>
            <li> <code>strstore</code> to <code>string</code> </li>
            <li> <code>vec</code> to <code>vector</code> </li>
        </ul>
    </p>

        Delayed for quite some time, work on the implementation of arithmetic was
        resumed this week.
        Static analyser gained support for arithmetic instructions, and
        new tests for them were written.
    </p>

    <p>
        However, implementing arithmetic takes time.
        Both signed and unsigned types must be considered, and
        then there are several variants of arithmetic.
    </p>

    <p>
        <strong><em>Wrapping</em></strong> arithmetic is the usual kind used when
        programming. When your value goes "out of range", you get overflow and
        the value is reduced modulo 2<sup>N</sup> where N is the width of the
        integer (which effectively means that only the <em>n least-significant</em>
        bits are actually used to store the result).
        <br>
        This type of arithmetic has its uses, and is what you typically expect when
        coming from a C or C++ background.
    </p>

    <p>
        <strong><em>Checked</em></strong> arithmetic works like you expect it to;
        2 plus 2 still gives four, but (assuming unsigned integers are used) 255 plus
        1 does not wrap to zero but throws an exception.
        <br>
        This kind of arithmetic is useful when you <em>need</em> to stay in range no
        matter what happens and you need to be notified when you would venture into the
        land of wraparound if not for the overflow checks performed by checked arithmetic.
    </p>

    <p>
        <strong><em>Saturating</em></strong> arithmetic ensures that you stay in range, but
        does not throw exceptions when you would go out of it - the value simply becomes
        "saturated".
        For example (assuming 8 bit unsigned integers) 253 + 8 gives 255 as 255 is the
        maximum representable value; similarly, 4 - 8 does not produce wraparound, it simply
        gives 0.
        <br>
        Saturating arithmetic is useful when "clipping" values is preferable to getting bogus
        results, e.g. increasing audio volume using the analog knob should not, after some
        time, result in the audio being muted - it should just reach the maximum level and
        stop increasing.
    </p>

    <p>
        <strong><em>Expanding</em></strong> arithmetic is the "natural" one.
        In contrast to the previous three kinds it does not operate on fixed-size integers.
        Under expanding arithmetic there is no wraparound, no saturation, and no "out of
        range" errors - values just grow as needed and the range of representable integers is
        limited only be the memory available to the program.
        In practice, though, Viua is expected to be able to handle numbers that can be
        represented using 2<sup>64</sup> binary digits (which still gives you plenty of wiggle
        room for fancy calculations).
