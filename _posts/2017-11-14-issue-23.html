<p>
    New arithmetic instructions have been implemented for Viua.
    They should mostly work, but need further testing.
    However, the instructions implemented so far are not even a half of what is needed to fully support
    wrap-around, checked, and saturating arithmetic modes.

    <p>
        Wrap-around arithmetic has been fully implemented for both signed and unsigned integers.
        Viua now provides <code>wrapadd</code>, <code>wrapmul</code>, and <code>wrapdiv</code> instructions.
    </p>

    <p>
        The new instructions are tested for 8 bit integers, but should work for any other bit width (the
        algorithms are the same no matter what bit width is used for the integers).

    <p>
        Viua now provides checked versions of addition, multiplication, and division for signed integers.
        There is no implementation yet for unsigned numbers, and division needs more testing.

    <p>
        Compilation with Clang 4.0 was problematic.
        The version of <code>libstdc++</code> that Clang 4 could understand it didn't include the
        headers (e.g. <code>&lt;optional&gt;</code>) required to compile Viua.
        But when the <code>libstdc++</code> was updated - Clang 4 would no longer be able to compile the
        standard library, since it was missing support for class template argument deducation (I think).
    </p>

    <p>
        This resulted in the support for compilation with Clang 4 being simply pulled, and
        the Clang 4.0 entry removed from CI build matrix.
    </p>

    <p>
        This <em>does not</em> mean that Clang cannot be used to compile Viua <em>at all</em>.
        Clang 5 is a fine compiler and is able to understand all of Viua source code, and all the new C++
        features used in newer <code>libstdc++</code> versions.
        Viua is not guaranteed to compile under Clang 4 and below, but with Clang 5 and above you should not
        encounter any problems.
