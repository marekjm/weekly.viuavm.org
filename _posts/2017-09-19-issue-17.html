        <h2> Initial jump analysis </h2>
        <p>
            New SA now understands <code>jump</code> instructions and is able to skip groups of
            instructions that would be skipped by jumps at runtime.
            <code>if</code> instructions are not yet supported.

        <h2> More "did you mean...?" notes </h2>

        <p>
            SA now issues "did you mean" notes for mistyped register set names during <code>ress</code>
            instruction analysis.
