<p>
    On Sunday 25th, version 0.9.0 of Viua VM was released into the world.
    This issue of Viua VM weekly is a commentary of this release.

    <p>
        This release is the biggest one in the history of Viua VM, and
        spans 1287 commits.
        It is not that surprising, given that previous version (0.8.4) of the VM was
        released <em><strong>10 months</strong></em> ago.
    </p>

    <p>
        Notable changes in this release are discussed in sub-sections below.
        New features are discussed in their own sections.
    </p>

    <section>
        <h2> <code>iota</code> compile-time keyword </h2>

        <p>
            The new compile-time <code>iota</code> keyword generated an ever-increasing integer
            starting from 1.
            It can be used to automatically assign register indexes:
        </p>

{% highlight asm %}
    .name: %iota answer     ; will be compiled as '.name: %1 answer'
    istore %answer local 42
    print %answer local
{% endhighlight %}

        <p>
            It is especially useful when code is changed, as the assembler will
            reindex the registers automatically and free the programmer from this
            task.
        </p>
    </section>

    <h1 id="{{ page.sections[1].id }}">{{ page.sections[1].name }}</h1>

    <p>
        The <code>tmpri</code> and <code>tmpro</code> instructions are no longer needed as the VM
        supports explicit register set specifiers for register operands.
        This means that to move a value from local register set to the static
        register set the following instruction can be used:
    </p>

{% highlight asm %}
    ; move <target> <source>
    move %1 static %1 local
{% endhighlight %}

    <p>
        ...instead of this sequence:
    </p>

{% highlight asm %}
    ress local
    tmpri %1
    ress static
    tmpro %1
{% endhighlight %}

    <p>
        Explicit register set specifiers make code shorter and more efficient.
    </p>
</section>

<section>
    <h1 id="{{ page.sections[2].id }}">{{ page.sections[2].name }}</h1>

    <p>
        The new <code>void</code> keyword can be used as a target register.
        Using void register as the target register will drop the value that
        would by normally produced by the instruction.
        Some examples:
    </p>

{% highlight asm %}
    ; drop the result of function call (if any)
    call void foo/0

    ; delete the value
    move void %1 local
{% endhighlight %}

    <p>
        Having void register in the VM means that the old hacks (i.e. using register 0 as
        "drop the result" register) are no longer necessary.
    </p>

    <h1 id="{{ page.sections[3].id }}">{{ page.sections[3].name }}</h1>

    <p>
        Starting with this release, Viua uses UTF-8 as its internal character
        set for text values.
        What is more, a special text type was added to the VM's list of
        primitive types.
        Text values must always be valid UTF-8.
    </p>

    <p>
        A <code>text*</code> family of instructions was introduced to distinguish text
        values from a "string of bytes" values produced by <code>strstore</code>
        instruction.
    </p>

{% highlight asm %}
    strstore %1 local "Hello World!"    ; old way of creating text values
    text %2 local "Hello World!"        ; new way of creating text values
{% endhighlight %}

    <p>
        As an additional feature, all values can be casted to text using the
        <code>text</code> instruction:
    </p>

{% highlight asm %}
    istore %1 local 42
    text %2 local %1 local      ; register 2 will contain text "42"
{% endhighlight %}
</section>

<section>
    <h1 id="{{ page.sections[4].id }}">{{ page.sections[4].name }}</h1>

    <p>
        A very useful feature.
        Deferred calls may be registered to be called when the frame they were
        registered in is popped off the stack (during unwinding, normal returns,
        or tail calls).
        They are useful as a debugging aid, and can be used to implement
        resource management schemes.
    </p>

    <p>
        Deferred calls were discussed in previous Viua VM Weekly posts, so they are given
        less text in this entry.
    </p>

    <h1 id="{{ page.sections[5].id }}">{{ page.sections[5].name }}</h1>

    <p>
        Blocking operations (<code>join</code> and <code>receive</code>) can now specify a timeout for
        how long they should block a process.
        The timeout may be specified in seconds, milliseconds, or
        as the <code>infinity</code> token.
    </p>

    <p>
        Some examples:
    </p>

{% highlight asm %}
    receive %1 local 1s     ; wait at least 1s for a message to arrive

    join void 100ms         ; wait at least 100ms for a process to
                            ; become joinable
    receive %1 local infinity   ; wait indefinitely
{% endhighlight %}

    <p>
        It is important to note that timeout durations are not exact, and
        represent the least amount of time the VM will wait before aborting the operation.
        The VM will abort the operation as soon as the process gets assigned a time slice, <em>and</em>
        the timeout has passed.
    </p>
