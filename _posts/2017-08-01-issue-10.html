    <p>
        Viua VM added bit string manipulation to the instruction set some time ago.
        Now, artihmetic on bit strings is in the works.

        <h2> Rationale </h2>

        <p>
            Implementing arithmetic in Viua VM that is independent of the underlying hardware
            is a step forward in making the VM more reliable and predictable.
            If the arithmetic is wholly contained inside the VM kernel than the VM defines the
            rules, and can prevent such errors as silent truncation of results.

        <h2> Design </h2>

        <p>
            The behaviour of bit strings arithmetic is still in a state of flux.
            Final definition of the semantics of bit string arithmetic will probably not come soon.
            Most probably there will be two sets of operations: a fixed one, keeping the width of
            the result the same as the width of the operands; and
            an "arithmetic" one, extending result as needed.

        <h2> Available operations </h2>

        <p>
            Operations implemented so far include increment, decrement, addition, subtraction (using two's complement), and
            multiplication.
