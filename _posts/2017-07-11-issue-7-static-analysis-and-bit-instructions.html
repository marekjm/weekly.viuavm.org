<p>
    Once again, the changes that landed during the week are not substantial, and
    more like little steps forward, slowly but steadily moving the VM further ahead,
    pushing it to a shape resembling something useful.
</p>

<p>
    This week also marks a milestone for Viua as it earned <a href="https://bestpractices.coreinfrastructure.org/projects/581">CII Best Practices</a> "Passing" badge, and
    run without bugs under <a href="https://clang-analyzer.llvm.org/">Clang static analyser</a>.

    <p>
        Clang static analyser did not found any bugs in Viua VM code.
        This result gives greater confidence than before that Viua is solid and reliable.
    </p>

    <p>
        Next goal is to run warning-free under TSan but it is a bit tricky.
        If you can help out with making Viua TSan-clear it would be a great opportunity to contribute!

        <h3> Coverity </h3>

        <p>
            For some, unknown to me, reason Coverity finds only 2% of object files emitted during Viua build.
            So no Coverity for Viua.

    <p>
        Bit instructions are being implemented on <code>issue/177/5534fb2a/implement-bit-manipulation-instructions</code> branch.
        New instructions include shifs, rotates, and single bit access to bit strings.
    </p>

    <p>
        Bit strings are also intended to support fixed-width integer arithmetic, but instructions for this purpose will be devised at a later time.
        Probably next week.
