<p>
    This week was spent on bug fixes, and enhancing memory tightness of the core VM.
</p>

<hr>

    <p>
        There were many places in the VM where the following construction was used:
    </p>

    {% highlight cpp %}
unique_ptr<viua::something::Something>(new viua::something::Something(42));
    {% endhighlight %}

    <p>
        It was unfortunate, since this construction can lead to memory leaks if an exception is thrown
        between the construction of new <code>viua::something::Something</code> and
        the moment it becomes guarded by the <code>unique_ptr</code>.
        Viua strives to correctly manage its memory, and account for every resource it allocates, so this
        was clearly unacceptable.
    </p>

    <p>
        The solution came in the form of <a href="http://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/memory/unique_ptr/make_unique"><code>std::make_unique()</code></a>.
        This function safely allocates memory, constructs an object, and wraps it in a <code>unique_ptr</code>.
        It also leads to shorter code and less repetition:
    </p>

    {% highlight cpp %}
/*
 * Type is repeated two times, and
 * memory can be leaked.
 */
auto a = unique_ptr<viua::something::Something>(new viua::something::Something(42));

/*
 * No repetition of 'viua::something::Something', and
 * it is much less likely that memory will be leaked.
 */
auto b = make_unique<viua::something::Something>(42);
    {% endhighlight %}

    <p>
        An embarrassing omission managed to slip past tests: bit strings always evaluated to false when used a Boolean values.
        This obviously incorrect behaviour was fixed.
        Bit strings containing at least one enabled bit evaluate to true, bit strings with all zeroes evaluate to false.
    </p>

    <h1 id="{{ page.sections[2].id }}">{{ page.sections[2].name }}</h1>

    <p>
        Another bug managed to sneak into the assembler: literal bit strings that were all zeroes were reduced to zero-width strings.
        This is fixed now, and literal all-zero bit strings are (correctly) reduced to one-zero strings.
        Examples:
    </p>

    {% highlight asm %}
0b00000000  ; is reduced to 0b0
0o00000000  ; is reduced to 0o0
0x00000000  ; is reduced to 0x0
    {% endhighlight %}

    <p>
        After stripping leading zeroes the width of the literal bit string is expanded to the nearest multiple of 8.
        This behaviour did not change.
    </p>

    <h1 id="{{ page.sections[3].id }}">{{ page.sections[3].name }}</h1>

    <p>
        Disassembly was fixed for <code>if</code>, <code>streq</code>, <code>insert</code>, and <code>remove</code> instructions.
        Their target registers were not disassembled with register set specifiers, which could change the meaning of the program being
        disassembled.
    </p>

    <p>
        The <code>if</code> instruction also did not support register set specifiers in source code <em>at all</em>.
        This is now fixed.
    </p>
