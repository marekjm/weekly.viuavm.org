    <h1 id="{{ page.sections[0].id }}">Stack traces</h1>

    <p>
        Stack traces are now printed to standard error instead of standard output.
        This simplifies logging and output capture.

<section>
    <h1 id="{{ page.sections[1].id }}">Deferred calls</h1>

    <p>
        Deferred calls are now invoked when stack is being unwound on unhandled exceptions.
        Suitable test has been added to the test suite.
