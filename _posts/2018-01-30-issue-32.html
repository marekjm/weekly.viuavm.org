<p>
    Once again, not much happened except for new documentation being written.
</p>

    <p>
        Documentation for Viua VM has been expanded by quite a few new chapters in the last week.
        The document has also been renamed to "Viua VM manual".
    </p>

    <p>
    Among the new instructions that were documented are
    <a href="https://docs.viuavm.org/manual.html#6-25"><code>process</code></a>,
    <a href="https://docs.viuavm.org/manual.html#6-18"><code>join</code></a> (both for concurrency),

    <a href="https://docs.viuavm.org/manual.html#6-10"><code>function</code></a> (create a function ref),
    <a href="https://docs.viuavm.org/manual.html#6-3"><code>call</code></a>,
    <a href="https://docs.viuavm.org/manual.html#6-23"><code>pamv</code></a> (pass a parameter by move),
    <a href="https://docs.viuavm.org/manual.html#6-24"><code>param</code></a> (pass a parameter by copy),
    <a href="https://docs.viuavm.org/manual.html#6-27"><code>return</code></a>,
    <a href="https://docs.viuavm.org/manual.html#6-8"><code>frame</code></a> (construct a call frame),
    <a href="https://docs.viuavm.org/manual.html#6-2"><code>arg</code></a> (obtain passed argument),

    and
    <a href="https://docs.viuavm.org/manual.html#6-13"><code>import</code></a>.
    </p>

    <p>
        The manual is now in an overall better shape as more references are now being used in text;
        especially the HTML version is now much more usable as the refs allow the reader to jump from
        one interesting section to the next.
    </p>

    <h2>Future content</h2>

    <p>
        The manual now also includes two sections that are just stubs to be be expanded in the future, but
        are tremendously important - the environment (that the VM provides), and the standard library.
    </p>

    <p>
        The first one will describe the environment in which the programs running on Viua VM are executed;
        this includes program organisation, description of available error handling techniques, how
        concurrency is realised in the VM, etc.
    </p>

    <p>
        The second will describe the standard library supplied with the VM (which so far is of poor
        quality, and extremely limited usefulness).

    <p>
        A <a href="https://docs.viuavm.org/manual.pdf">PDF version</a> has been made available to
        accompany the HTML and plaintext versions.
